          Hi there! I'm Ari. I'm a student at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. I make games and music. I also make spoofs of
          albums I like by photoshopping myself onto the covers. Occasionally, I
          also make jokes. Watch out for those. Promise it'll be worth it. I
          love to solve problems creatively, be they anywhere on the spectrum
          from unique sorting algorithms to figuring out you can put hot dogs in
          the air fryer. I work well in teams and have no problem adjusting to
          any dynamic. I love working with people who have crazy, ambitious
          ideas and I love figuring out how to make ideas work. If you'd like to
          collaborate on anything (and I mean anything), please don't be shy to
          contact me!
