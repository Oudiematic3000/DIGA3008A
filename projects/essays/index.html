          The paradoxical dichotomy of South Africa is that of a government
          determined to keep up with worldwide technological standards while one
          of its largest demographics is still stunted in their access to smart
          technology from the lasting effects of a now decades-defunct
          oppressive regime. The bare minimum that is required of a government
          website is to be accessible to its target users and to aid those
          target users. Do South African government websites consider this? This
          essay addresses the worst offender of the country’s official websites:
          The website for the South African Social Security Agency- and
          discusses how it utterly fails to consider its biggest demographic;
          analyses its haphazard UI/UX design choices and examines what effects
          poor UI/UX design have on the South African people.
        </p>

        <h3>Context on SASSA</h3>

        <p>
          SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) is a government agency
          responsible for providing social grants to economically vulnerable of
          South Africa, such as those in need of child support, people with
          disabilities and crucially: older people. It is also responsible for
          dissemination of correct information to the public and according to
          the website’s values page, it values ‘Integrity, being honest,
          accountable, reliable and showing high moral values.’ [1]
        </p>
        <h3>SASSA’s Neglected Userbase</h3>
        <p>
          As of 2024, approximately 6,1 million people in South Africa are over
          the age of 60. [2] According to a 2020 census, 72% of that older
          population relies on social grants from SASSA. Additionally, 71% of
          older persons receiving social grants belong to ethnic groups
          previously oppressed under the Apartheid regime. [3] All this to say
          that SASSA’s target audience is largely older persons and the
          economically impoverished. Good UI/UX design is about designing your
          website for your target audience. Has SASSA considered their target
          audience in their UI/UX design? A 2022 study on older South Africans’
          use of cell phones and the development of an information sharing app
          for this group found that 91% of older persons in South Africa used
          pushbutton phones. [4] This is supported by sales from South Africa’s
          mobile retailers indicating that feature phones are still popular
          among the economically vulnerable and the elderly. Popular feature
          phone brands such as Nokia, Mobicel, Itel, and Stylo have average
          screen resolutions of 130x200 pixels. [5, 6] This is what SASSA’s
          website looks like at this screen ratio:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSAFeaturePhoneRatio.png"
            alt="SASSA's website unusable and unadjusted for a feature phone"
          />
          <figcaption>Figure 1: SASSA homepage at 130x200px [7]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Immediately, the website is unusable on 91% of the cellular phones of
          its biggest demographic- and that’s with the merciful assumption of an
          internet browser working on a feature phone in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          SASSA’s demographic also largely encompasses people with disabilities.
          In 2020 there were an estimated 11 million people in South Africa with
          vision loss, 370 thousand of which were blind. [7] SASSA’s homepage
          features a scrolling image display. Enabling a screen reader on any
          image except the first one causes the page to be interpreted
          incorrectly and display almost no information:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSAScreenRead.png"
            alt="SASSA's website missing main content when parsed through a screenreader."
          />
          <figcaption>

            scrolled to the 2nd image. [7]
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          How is it that a government agency whose objective is to aid these
          vulnerable groups can so egregiously overlook them in the design of
          their website – a communication channel that has become the global
          standard for accessing information?
        </p>
        <h3>SASSA’s Subpar UI/UX Design</h3>
        <p>
          While SASSA’s website may be borderline inoperable for these groups,
          its UI/UX design is negligent and half-baked even for users who
          wouldn’t need any accessibility consideration. The header of the home
          page is an image carousel. The images are non-intractable and mostly
          introduce the SASSA heads of department. One of the slides prompts the
          reader to find their COVID-SRD (Social Relief of Distress) application
          status. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the website that this grant
          may still apply in 2025 to those who were affected by COVID and not
          that it’s simply an out of date announcement- we are met with this
          when navigating to the COVID-SRD grant page:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSABlankGrantPage.png"
            alt="SASSA's blank COVID-SRD grant page."
          />
          <figcaption>Figure 3: The blank COVID-SRD grant page. [7]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          As with most of this site’s content, it is not possible to know
          whether this content is outdated, missing or removed- leaving users
          confused and unaided. Another link to the COVID-SRD grant page links
          directly to the general grant application page which is deceptive and
          may lead users to apply for the incorrect grant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search bar on the home page seems to function by searching the
          website’s folder structure for HTML pages and returning them as links
          to said pages. Some pages behave erroneously when accessed in this
          manner. The mission and values page displays barebones, unparsed HTML
          code when accessed this way:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSARawHTML.png"
            alt="Unedited screenshot of the Mission and Values page as accessed from the search bar."
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 4: Unedited screenshot of the Mission and Values page as
            accessed from the search bar. [9]
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The homepage feed appears to be recent announcements, the most recent
          being “Tips on how to identify fake vacancies and fake news.” Another
          blank page. The rest of the entries on the front page consist of
          single low resolution screenshots of posters, with one entry being the
          second page of a document supposedly containing the grant payment
          dates for April 2025. Poetically, the first line on this page reads
          “For more information […] Contact SASSA customer care.” [10]
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right side of the page there are social media widgets for the
          SASSA Twitter and Facebook pages. The Twitter widget does not display
          at all. The Facebook widget does not resize its content to fit the
          block and as such doesn’t convey any useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site also features a “SASSA slide gallery” on the left sidebar.
          The display is animated with jarring 3D transitions, the fullscreen
          button does not work and the images themselves are non-descript photos
          of SASSA staff with no captions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the existence of a disclaimer page warning that the website -
          for the government agency responsible for aiding the country’s most
          vulnerable groups - might contain erroneous content and they don't
          accept any responsibility for their misinformation or out of date
          information. This is unacceptable. As earlier stated, the bare minimum
          that is required of a government website is to be accessible to its
          target users and to aid those target users. A government website may
          not simply excuse itself from ethical design, correct and current
          information and accountability.

        <h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
        <p>
          There remains large gaps in access to internet technology in the
          world: between the youth and elderly, between the privileged and
          underprivileged, between rural and urban communities. Ethical UI/UX
          design should ultimately be about minimising these gaps, especially in
          South Africa where these larger demographics are underrepresented in
          design considerations. Nanjira Sambuli advocates that the first step
          in removing these inequalities is adopting a ‘no-one-gets-left-behind’
          design philosophy for the sustainable development of technology. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
          The South African peoples’ disdain for government bureaucracy is
          tragically a unifying force for the nation. The research paper cited
          earlier on the development of Yabelana (an information dissemination
          app designed for older South Africans) found that technological
          artefacts and websites can be effective means of communicating data
          with the older population and that with proper guidance and training,
          they felt mastery and confidence in their ability to use the app to
          find needed information. [4, 4 page 80] It is not above our means to
          design technology with these groups in mind and it is not above their
          means to utilise it. There is a future in which South Africa is united
          by their confidence in the government to deliver adequate services to
          the entire nation. It is up to us as the people to make these issues
          known and it is up to the government of South Africa to remember them
          and the people they affect.

        In the modern era, the internet cannot be separated from politics. It is both influenced by and used as a tool for state interests, legislation and corporate profit. Simultaneously, it is also a means of entertainment, social connection and education. Bordering these sectors of the online space from each other has been largely forgotten as a priority. One study found a significant connection between online content consumption and radicalised views in the youth [1]. Additionally, incidents extending to acts of terrorism committed by minors have become far more commonplace in recent years [2]. 
        </p>

        <h3>The Online Safety Act</h3>

        <p>
          In 2023, a UK online safety act was drafted to come into force in 2025, which would have platforms conduct risk assessments, implement safety measures to shield children from harm and ban illegal content and implement robust content report systems [3]. Additionally, larger platforms should prevent fraudulent advertising and safeguard journalistic and democratically significant content [3]. The act also pushes to define new criminal offences such as threat messages, encouragement of harmful behaviours and crucially: harmful spreading of misinformation [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          This act has extraterritorial reach, and challenges the US’s current control over the global representation of online information and holds companies like Google, Amazon and Meta accountable.
        </p>
        <h3>How the US Shapes the Internet</h3>
        <p>
         The leading edge of technology (through Silicon Valley companies such as Google and Amazon) was once a for-the-people effort without direct ties to the government. Arguably, the freedom of expression that smart technology and social media ushered in created a libertarian counter culture and mostly democratic internet. Long gone is that age. Silicon Valley is now closely tied to and often aligned with the interests of the US government [5]. The hand that self-proclaimed ‘technoking’, billionaire, tech mogul Elon Musk had in US politics from 2024 to the first half of 2025 cannot be understated. Posting AI-generated imagery of the opposing party as propaganda, biasing algorithmic engagement towards right-wing content on X (formerly Twitter) and laying off previous trust and safety staff that were responsible for election policy, platform manipulation and disinformation [6, 7, 8].
        </p>
  What are the consequences for the global community of internet users when the leading superpower and state in control of majority of online content is so rife with political messaging? The erasure of any representation of countries outside of the global north (the US especially) and the lack of perspectives online that aren’t parsed by the US government is perhaps the greatest threat of digital colonialism.
        <p>
          Immediately, the website is unusable on 91% of the cellular phones of
          its biggest demographic- and that’s with the merciful assumption of an
          internet browser working on a feature phone in the first place.
        </p>
       <h3>Digital Colonialism and the US Reaction</h3>
        <p>
         Despite the UK, also being a global power, the Online Safety Act is a strong step towards a more democratic online space. It is vitally important to have countries in the global north use their platform to fight against digital colonialism. The Online Safety Act challenges Silicon Valley’s (and thus the US government’s) exceptionalism. No party that’s main objective is profit should control the infrastructure that shapes the politics of a country whose politics have global consequences- especially when many of the affected countries have no platform to oppose the status quo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reaction from the US to the act however, was not compliant. President Donald Trump condemned the Act, claiming it was a territorial overreach and had no grounds on US territory and that it threatened the US economy through its detriment to US digital services. In a staggering act of irony, Trump also claimed the act infringed on free speech by allowing government interference on social media [9]. In April 2025, the US placed a 10% tariff on UK exports in retaliation to the Online Safety Act [10]. The US continues to maintain its power over the digital space, going so far as to frame an act that’s core purpose is to protect users from illegal content or harmful misinformation, as an illegitimate censorship of free speech. If digital colonialism ever needed to be clarified, it would most easily be put as a global superpower imposing the ultimatum of allowing harmful information to be spread to the population or facing economic downfall through tariffs upon smaller countries.
        </p>
        <h3>The Future of the Internet</h3>
        <p>
         Despite the threat of the US, the Online Safety Act was passed and remains in place. Since the drafting of the act, other countries have also begun to prioritise user safety [11]. It is possible that the world will see a large shift in the shape of the internet in the next decade. The global population is not blind to the influence big tech has on US politics and how much control the US has over global perception. The burden is on other countries in the global north to take action to protect their own citizens, and the global population from biased or incorrect information and to give smaller countries a platform and legislative foundation to do the same.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
         Is there a future where the internet is not used to further the political interests of tech corporations, but rather used to provide an unbiased political education for the global population? Is there a future where children are able to interact with the internet safely, without being exposed to radical propaganda or illegal content? Is there a future where every country has an equal platform to distribute information and protect their populations? A massive amount of change must happen to get to this future. Internet laws are difficult to pass, specifically because of the competing interests of billion-dollar tech corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not an impossible future however, the UK’s tenacity in making the Online Safety Act non-negotiable is an exemplary step in the right direction. As a user of the internet outside of the US, the most action one can take is to voice these issues and help to make others in one’s own community aware of the influence US politics has on the content they consume. Digital colonialism can be mitigated and humanity’s continued stride towards a more democratic society is bound to achieve a more equal and safe internet.
