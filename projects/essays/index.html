          The paradoxical dichotomy of South Africa is that of a government
          determined to keep up with worldwide technological standards while one
          of its largest demographics is still stunted in their access to smart
          technology from the lasting effects of a now decades-defunct
          oppressive regime. The bare minimum that is required of a government
          website is to be accessible to its target users and to aid those
          target users. Do South African government websites consider this? This
          essay addresses the worst offender of the country’s official websites:
          The website for the South African Social Security Agency- and
          discusses how it utterly fails to consider its biggest demographic;
          analyses its haphazard UI/UX design choices and examines what effects
          poor UI/UX design have on the South African people.
        </p>

        <h3>Context on SASSA</h3>

        <p>
          SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) is a government agency
          responsible for providing social grants to economically vulnerable of
          South Africa, such as those in need of child support, people with
          disabilities and crucially: older people. It is also responsible for
          dissemination of correct information to the public and according to
          the website’s values page, it values ‘Integrity, being honest,
          accountable, reliable and showing high moral values.’ [1]
        </p>
        <h3>SASSA’s Neglected Userbase</h3>
        <p>
          As of 2024, approximately 6,1 million people in South Africa are over
          the age of 60. [2] According to a 2020 census, 72% of that older
          population relies on social grants from SASSA. Additionally, 71% of
          older persons receiving social grants belong to ethnic groups
          previously oppressed under the Apartheid regime. [3] All this to say
          that SASSA’s target audience is largely older persons and the
          economically impoverished. Good UI/UX design is about designing your
          website for your target audience. Has SASSA considered their target
          audience in their UI/UX design? A 2022 study on older South Africans’
          use of cell phones and the development of an information sharing app
          for this group found that 91% of older persons in South Africa used
          pushbutton phones. [4] This is supported by sales from South Africa’s
          mobile retailers indicating that feature phones are still popular
          among the economically vulnerable and the elderly. Popular feature
          phone brands such as Nokia, Mobicel, Itel, and Stylo have average
          screen resolutions of 130x200 pixels. [5, 6] This is what SASSA’s
          website looks like at this screen ratio:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSAFeaturePhoneRatio.png"
            alt="SASSA's website unusable and unadjusted for a feature phone"
          />
          <figcaption>Figure 1: SASSA homepage at 130x200px [7]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Immediately, the website is unusable on 91% of the cellular phones of
          its biggest demographic- and that’s with the merciful assumption of an
          internet browser working on a feature phone in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          SASSA’s demographic also largely encompasses people with disabilities.
          In 2020 there were an estimated 11 million people in South Africa with
          vision loss, 370 thousand of which were blind. [7] SASSA’s homepage
          features a scrolling image display. Enabling a screen reader on any
          image except the first one causes the page to be interpreted
          incorrectly and display almost no information:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSAScreenRead.png"
            alt="SASSA's website missing main content when parsed through a screenreader."
          />
          <figcaption>

            scrolled to the 2nd image. [7]
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          How is it that a government agency whose objective is to aid these
          vulnerable groups can so egregiously overlook them in the design of
          their website – a communication channel that has become the global
          standard for accessing information?
        </p>
        <h3>SASSA’s Subpar UI/UX Design</h3>
        <p>
          While SASSA’s website may be borderline inoperable for these groups,
          its UI/UX design is negligent and half-baked even for users who
          wouldn’t need any accessibility consideration. The header of the home
          page is an image carousel. The images are non-intractable and mostly
          introduce the SASSA heads of department. One of the slides prompts the
          reader to find their COVID-SRD (Social Relief of Distress) application
          status. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the website that this grant
          may still apply in 2025 to those who were affected by COVID and not
          that it’s simply an out of date announcement- we are met with this
          when navigating to the COVID-SRD grant page:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSABlankGrantPage.png"
            alt="SASSA's blank COVID-SRD grant page."
          />
          <figcaption>Figure 3: The blank COVID-SRD grant page. [7]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          As with most of this site’s content, it is not possible to know
          whether this content is outdated, missing or removed- leaving users
          confused and unaided. Another link to the COVID-SRD grant page links
          directly to the general grant application page which is deceptive and
          may lead users to apply for the incorrect grant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search bar on the home page seems to function by searching the
          website’s folder structure for HTML pages and returning them as links
          to said pages. Some pages behave erroneously when accessed in this
          manner. The mission and values page displays barebones, unparsed HTML
          code when accessed this way:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/SASSARawHTML.png"
            alt="Unedited screenshot of the Mission and Values page as accessed from the search bar."
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 4: Unedited screenshot of the Mission and Values page as
            accessed from the search bar. [9]
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The homepage feed appears to be recent announcements, the most recent
          being “Tips on how to identify fake vacancies and fake news.” Another
          blank page. The rest of the entries on the front page consist of
          single low resolution screenshots of posters, with one entry being the
          second page of a document supposedly containing the grant payment
          dates for April 2025. Poetically, the first line on this page reads
          “For more information […] Contact SASSA customer care.” [10]
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right side of the page there are social media widgets for the
          SASSA Twitter and Facebook pages. The Twitter widget does not display
          at all. The Facebook widget does not resize its content to fit the
          block and as such doesn’t convey any useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site also features a “SASSA slide gallery” on the left sidebar.
          The display is animated with jarring 3D transitions, the fullscreen
          button does not work and the images themselves are non-descript photos
          of SASSA staff with no captions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the existence of a disclaimer page warning that the website -
          for the government agency responsible for aiding the country’s most
          vulnerable groups - might contain erroneous content and they don't
          accept any responsibility for their misinformation or out of date
          information. This is unacceptable. As earlier stated, the bare minimum
          that is required of a government website is to be accessible to its
          target users and to aid those target users. A government website may
          not simply excuse itself from ethical design, correct and current
          information and accountability.

        <h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
        <p>
          There remains large gaps in access to internet technology in the
          world: between the youth and elderly, between the privileged and
          underprivileged, between rural and urban communities. Ethical UI/UX
          design should ultimately be about minimising these gaps, especially in
          South Africa where these larger demographics are underrepresented in
          design considerations. Nanjira Sambuli advocates that the first step
          in removing these inequalities is adopting a ‘no-one-gets-left-behind’
          design philosophy for the sustainable development of technology. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
          The South African peoples’ disdain for government bureaucracy is
          tragically a unifying force for the nation. The research paper cited
          earlier on the development of Yabelana (an information dissemination
          app designed for older South Africans) found that technological
          artefacts and websites can be effective means of communicating data
          with the older population and that with proper guidance and training,
          they felt mastery and confidence in their ability to use the app to
          find needed information. [4, 4 page 80] It is not above our means to
          design technology with these groups in mind and it is not above their
          means to utilise it. There is a future in which South Africa is united
          by their confidence in the government to deliver adequate services to
          the entire nation. It is up to us as the people to make these issues
          known and it is up to the government of South Africa to remember them
          and the people they affect.
