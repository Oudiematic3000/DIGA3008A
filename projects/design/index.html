        <p>
          The first wireframe I made featured an idea with four bass strings on
          the landing page, with a nav bar at the top of the page. While maybe
          not the worst idea, playing off a bass having four strings as a visual
          motif rather than playing off its role or using audio stimuli is much
          less effective and just generally vague.
        </p>
        <p>That's why we iterate though!</p>

            Once I settled on my fader idea (Which you can read all about <a href="../blog/index.html#blog3">here</a>), I played around with various layouts. In this one,
            The background was a subtle gradient and the fader was positioned in the center of the page. I quickly decided I preferred the monochrome, full black background to contrast
            the white typeface and possible visual flare I plan on adding in the background. The centered fader was also moved left because I figured it would be confusing to scroll down the site
            with the mouse positioned in the center of the screen and you might expect the fader to scroll instead. Having it left aligned also makes it a nice margin for the title card.

            Ultimately, I want the home page to be a continuous scroll through the various pages of the website (or snippets of them in the case of projects and blogs). The alignment goal
            for the website is simple, communicable, flavourful. It should be easy to use and navigate, give a good picture of me as a creative and collaborator and be thematically consistent
            with the bass theme throughout.
          </p>
          <p>
            My target audience is employers and collaborators. The site should appeal to contemporaries in music, game design or programming who would like to employ me or work with me. Therefore I'd like to show projects in these fields as examples of what I can do.

            The bold blockiness of Big John matches the boldness I'm trying to convey in the website and its bassy feel. Metropolis is a very clean, modern font that is legible
            and will look good in conjunction with Big John.

        <h3>Statement:</h3>
        <p>The goal aesthetic is bold, minimalist, monochrome.</p>
        <h3>Visual Designs: </h3>
        <p>The landing page of the site was always going to feature an introduction by making the user fade in a bass track to a melody while simultaneously fading in my title card to immediately connect my character to the role of bass.
        </p>

            <figcaption class="p-summary">Final Wireframes.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p> Some helpful feedback from a classmate suggested I add visual flare to this for users who do not have access to audio. In light of this, The page now opens with a minimalist scene of a night sky, with stars pulsing with the initial melody. As the user fades in the bass, the EQ spectrum of the bass is also faded in visually, representing mountains to complete the scene.</p>

          <p class="e-content">
            The monochrome palette helps to accentuate the showcase content rather than distract from it with the website visuals and text. Additionally, I at least find darker backgrounds easier on the eyes and much more cinematic and intriguing.

    <p>
        This is a style guide for a fictional company called Unicorn Guard that produces a dye to dye rhino horns in order to devalue them to poachers. A group of teammates and I had 2 hours to devise
        and produce a coherent, well thought out style for their website.

<section class="e-content">
    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>
        We used a pallete of muted earth tones to reference the savannah and game park aesthetic (Khaki game ranger uniforms, stone, grass, mud). Then we added a burnt orange as
        an accent colour to add visual interest which works well with the rest of the palette and references the sunset or the savannah at golden hour. Finally contrasting blue, referencing
        the dye (the product we're selling) and would be used to highlight important features like buttons.
    </p>

<section class="e-content">
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p>
        We used NOFEX for headings. In our initial brainstorm, we were trying to decide the tone of our website. Is Unicorn Guard a friendly non-profit that wants you to join them in conserving nature? Or are they
        an almost militaristic anti-poaching corp that is warning not to mess with Rhinos?
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually we decided on an inbetween point where our website should be determined and serious about this issue, but not overly aggressive.
        NOFEX matches that serious, bold tone but still looks modern and stoic.
    </p>
    <p>
        We chose Lato as our body text font without too much deliberation. It's approachable and clean and looks good next to NOFEX.

    <h3>Visual Motif</h3>
    <p>
        A visual motif of a rhino horn curves throughout the page, just to keep the reader constantly aware of the product and the issue at hand.
