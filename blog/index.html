        <h3>GitHub:</h3>

        <p>
          It would be presumptuous of me to say I'm good friends with Git- but
          I'd at least like to say we're well acquainted. I have used it in many
          personal projects and have found a structure that works well and I've
          used it on occasion to borrow other people's solutions to extremely
          niche software problems. I'm excited to learn more of what it's
          capable of this year.

        <h3>Reading - How a Screen Reader User Accesses the Internet</h3>

        <p>
          This article (video mostly) covers how screen reader applications
          interpret web pages and the accessibility challenges that face
          visually impaired users. While completely coincidental, the tree
          structure layout of HTML based webpages makes them extremely
          accessible. Screen Reader Applications (SRAs here forward) can access
          the hidden formatting of HTML webpages to convey information like the
          website title, headings, navigations, hypertext, sections, etc. This
          is extremely cool but, I wonder how much more difficult it will become
          for SRAs to interpret websites as UX/UI design trends become more
          creative and dynamic. Will we see a greater push for intentionally
          designed accessibility features on websites, or will SRAs be improved
          to deal with nonstandard layouts? I'm quite interested in the struggle
          a lot of digital media deals with between maintaining the intended
          experience of it while also making it as accessible as possible. In
          the article, an example is shown for a website that uses scripts to
          visually hide certain headings on the web page until various fields
          are filled in. The user's SRA however, reads the headings as occurring
          just after the title, even though they are not visually apparent on
          screen. Additionally, multiple input fields lack proper descriptors
          and are skipped over. The website is arguably well designed and clear
          for able users, but borderline unusable for a visually impaired user.
          It is interesting to see how historically, the internet might have
          been more accessible in its simpler, earlier state. If there are any
          conventions or best-practices for accessibility in Javascript for
          WebDev, it would be very cool to learn them this semester.
        </p>
        <h3>Course Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I would love to be able to use whatever website that comes out of this
          course as a personal CV. Javascript might be the most universally
          loved and hated language simultaneously and I would very much like to
          call myself competent in it.

        <h3>Reading</h3>

        <p>
          Moulthrop's essay was a fulfilling read that brings up many poignant
          ideas about hypertext and the internet that are observable in our
          modern internet today. Let's rewind. We have a new technology. We can
          now link information to other, related information in a manner that
          can only be achieved through the digital access of this decentralized
          knowledge. It's called Hypertext. Go wild - The world is yours. Surely
          this would bring about massive cultural and educational upheaval in
          the world, but that's not exactly what we see. Hypertext, in theory,
          should democratize knowledge and the ability to educate yourself and
          others through the web. However, the essay compares our finding of
          this new system to May 68:
          <i
            >'we have taken over the station only to resume normal methods of
            broadcasting.'</i
          >

          This new web is adapted to much like every other form of media has
          been in the past. It is snatched up by corporations and tech companies
          to advertise and modernise. Moulthrop emphasizes the apparent
          strangeness in the lack of sudden, radical change in culture with the
          advent of this new technology. Moulthrop posits a few explanations for
          this: Maybe it's because the enterprising generation at the time were
          always obsessed with the 'next big thing'; maybe it's because a
          'revolution' looks fundamentally different in modern times. Observing
          the world today (as in 2025), can we say that the revolutionary
          hypertext culture is the status quo? The essay aptly states that
          <i>'Hypertext is all about connection, linkage, and affiliation.'</i>
          The nature of hypertext is to mimic the way humans actually process
          knowledge and think thoughts. I don't think it's implausible to say
          that people didn't immediately epiphanise at the commercialising of
          hypertext because the concept is actually quite natural to us. The
          essay also asks if we'd want a revolution at all. What would happen if
          we pushed this system to its absolute limits? It warns about how
          systems taken to their extremes often do exactly the opposite of their
          intention. Looking at the world today, have we come to a point where a
          system designed to democratise knowledge gathering and sharing is
          instead being used to make knowledge exclusive or untrustworthy?

          <i
            >'Responsibility for the evolution of hypertext systems as genuine
            alternatives to the present information economy rests as much with
            software developers, social scientists, and literary theorists as it
            does with legislators and capitalists.'</i
          >

          Well said, Moulthrop, and decades after the publishing of this essay-
          we still lack proper legislation around dissemination of information
          online. An irony of the modern web is that it takes the same amount of
          effort to be fully traceable as it does to be fully untraceable. As
          Humans do, we will continue to pioneer new technology before we've had
          the time to regulate last year's bleeding edge. With LLMs and GAI
          rapidly gaining steam, is there time for ethics and law to catch up
          before too much harm is done?

            I plan on theming my website around the bass guitar. I'm a bassist
            and I think there's quite a few parallels between the role of bass
            in music and the adjectives employers like to see on your portfolio.
            This is rough idea of what the landing page might look like but I'm
            trying not to get attached to an idea yet.
