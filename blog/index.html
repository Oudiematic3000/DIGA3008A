    <h3>GitHub:</h3>

    <p>It would be presumptuous of me to say I'm good friends with Git- but I'd at least like to say we're well acquainted. I have used it in many personal projects and have found a structure that works well and I've used it on occasion to borrow other people's solutions to extremely niche software problems. I'm excited to learn more of what it's capable of this year.

     <h3>Reading - How a Screen Reader User Accesses the Internet</h3>

    <p>This article (video mostly) covers how screen reader applications interpret web pages and the accessibility challenges that face visually impaired users. While completely coincidental, the tree structure layout of HTML based webpages makes them extremely accessible. Screen Reader Applications (SRAs here forward) can access the hidden formatting of HTML webpages to convey information like the website title, headings, navigations, hypertext, sections, etc. This is extremely cool but, I wonder how much more difficult it will become for SRAs to interpret websites as UX/UI design trends become more creative and dynamic. Will we see a greater push for intentionally designed accessibility features on websites, or will SRAs be improved to deal with nonstandard layouts? I'm quite interested in the struggle a lot of digital media deals with between maintaining the intended experience of it while also making it as accessible as possible.

In the article, an example is shown for a website that uses scripts to visually hide certain headings on the web page until various fields are filled in. The user's SRA however, reads the headings as occurring just after the title, even though they are not visually apparent on screen. Additionally, multiple input fields lack proper descriptors and are skipped over. The website is arguably well designed and clear for able users, but borderline unusable for a visually impaired user. It is interesting to see how historically, the internet might have been more accessible in its simpler, earlier state. If there are any conventions or best-practices for accessibility in Javascript for WebDev, it would be very cool to learn them this semester.

<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p>I would love to be able to use whatever website that comes out of this course as a personal CV. Javascript might be the most universally loved and hated language simultaneously and I would very much like to call myself competent in it.
