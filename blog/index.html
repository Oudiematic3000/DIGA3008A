        <p>
          It would be presumptuous of me to say I'm good friends with Git- but
          I'd at least like to say we're well acquainted. I have used it in many
          personal projects and have found a structure that works well and I've
          used it on occasion to borrow other people's solutions to extremely
          niche software problems. I'm excited to learn more of what it's
          capable of this year.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading - How a Screen Reader User Accesses the Internet</h3>

        <p>
          This article (video mostly) covers how screen reader applications
          interpret web pages and the accessibility challenges that face
          visually impaired users. While completely coincidental, the tree
          structure layout of HTML based webpages makes them extremely
          accessible. Screen Reader Applications (SRAs here forward) can access
          the hidden formatting of HTML webpages to convey information like the
          website title, headings, navigations, hypertext, sections, etc. This
          is extremely cool but, I wonder how much more difficult it will become
          for SRAs to interpret websites as UX/UI design trends become more
          creative and dynamic. Will we see a greater push for intentionally
          designed accessibility features on websites, or will SRAs be improved
          to deal with nonstandard layouts? I'm quite interested in the struggle
          a lot of digital media deals with between maintaining the intended
          experience of it while also making it as accessible as possible. In
          the article, an example is shown for a website that uses scripts to
          visually hide certain headings on the web page until various fields
          are filled in. The user's SRA however, reads the headings as occurring
          just after the title, even though they are not visually apparent on
          screen. Additionally, multiple input fields lack proper descriptors
          and are skipped over. The website is arguably well designed and clear
          for able users, but borderline unusable for a visually impaired user.
          It is interesting to see how historically, the internet might have
          been more accessible in its simpler, earlier state. If there are any
          conventions or best-practices for accessibility in Javascript for
          WebDev, it would be very cool to learn them this semester.
        </p>
        <h3>Course Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I would love to be able to use whatever website that comes out of this
          course as a personal CV. Javascript might be the most universally
          loved and hated language simultaneously and I would very much like to
          call myself competent in it.

        <h3>Reading</h3>

        <p>
          Moulthrop's essay was a fulfilling read that brings up many poignant
          ideas about hypertext and the internet that are observable in our
          modern internet today. Let's rewind. We have a new technology. We can
          now link information to other, related information in a manner that
          can only be achieved through the digital access of this decentralized
          knowledge. It's called Hypertext. Go wild - The world is yours. Surely
          this would bring about massive cultural and educational upheaval in
          the world, but that's not exactly what we see. Hypertext, in theory,
          should democratize knowledge and the ability to educate yourself and
          others through the web. However, the essay compares our finding of
          this new system to May 68:
          <cite
            >'we have taken over the station only to resume normal methods of
            broadcasting.'</cite
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This new web is adapted to much like every other form of media has
          been in the past. It is snatched up by corporations and tech companies
          to advertise and modernise. Moulthrop emphasizes the apparent
          strangeness in the lack of sudden, radical change in culture with the
          advent of this new technology. Moulthrop posits a few explanations for
          this: Maybe it's because the enterprising generation at the time were
          always obsessed with the 'next big thing'; maybe it's because a
          'revolution' looks fundamentally different in modern times. Observing
          the world today (as in 2025), can we say that the revolutionary
          hypertext culture is the status quo? The essay aptly states that
          <cite
            >'Hypertext is all about connection, linkage, and
            affiliation.'</cite
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The nature of hypertext is to mimic the way humans actually process
          knowledge and think thoughts. I don't think it's implausible to say
          that people didn't immediately epiphanise at the commercialising of
          hypertext because the concept is actually quite natural to us. The
          essay also asks if we'd want a revolution at all. What would happen if
          we pushed this system to its absolute limits? It warns about how
          systems taken to their extremes often do exactly the opposite of their
          intention. Looking at the world today, have we come to a point where a
          system designed to democratise knowledge gathering and sharing is
          instead being used to make knowledge exclusive or untrustworthy?
        </p>
        <p>
          <cite
            >'Responsibility for the evolution of hypertext systems as genuine
            alternatives to the present information economy rests as much with
            software developers, social scientists, and literary theorists as it

          Well said, Moulthrop, and decades after the publishing of this essay-
          we still lack proper legislation around dissemination of information
          online. An irony of the modern web is that it takes the same amount of
          effort to be fully traceable as it does to be fully untraceable. As
          Humans do, we will continue to pioneer new technology before we've had
          the time to regulate last year's bleeding edge. With LLMs and GAI
          rapidly gaining steam, is there time for ethics and law to catch up
          before too much harm is done?

          I plan on theming my website around the bass guitar. I'm a bassist and
          I think there's quite a few parallels between the role of bass in
          music and the adjectives employers like to see on your portfolio. This
          is rough idea of what the landing page might look like but I'm trying
          not to get attached to an idea yet.

        <h3>Website:</h3>

        <p>
          There was a moment during the lecture on Interaction Design last week
          where we started talking about what we want your users to do and see
          on the website and what interface elements they would be interacting
          with. Throughout the discussion, ideas just came like rain. Fate would
          have it that our lecturer showed us how to reference a lecture in the
          same lecture she beamed a website into my brain.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <cite>
            Geyser, H. (2023) 'Designing Interaction', [Lecture], WSOA3028A:
            Interactive Media 3A, University of the Witwatersrand, 27 February
            2025.
          </cite>
        </ul>
        <p>Great lecture. Let's put it to use:</p>

        <h3>Alignment:</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to create a portfolio website that introduces the user to
          me, not just through what I write about myself but through its
          presentation. Simple to use and navigate - If possible within the
          scope of the assignment, I want the website to only ever introduce one
          feature at a time. Additionally, I'd like for the nav menu to bring
          content to the page, rather than redirecting to another page.
          Communicable - I don't want this website to give the user a vague
          concept of me as a character, I want it to function as a professional
          portfolio and I want the user to think about hiring me with every
          scroll of their mouse wheel. It should be full of flavor but not
          unapproachable. Artful in presentation, clear and concise in text.
        </p>

        <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
        <p>
          My target audience is employers and collaborators. The site should
          appeal to contemporaries in music, game design or programming who
          would like to employ me or work with me. Therefore I'd like to show
          projects in these fields as examples of what I can do.
        </p>
        <h3>Content & User Experience:</h3>
        <p>
          The landing page of the website will have nothing but a fader (a
          slider semantically) and text saying 'bring in the bass,' with a
          musical track playing (with no bassline). As the User slides this
          fader up, the bassline of the track will fade in simultaneously with
          text introducing myself with some adjectives describing both me and
          the role of bass in music. As they scroll down, the nav menu will
          appear which they can then use to browse blogs, projects (possibly
          categorized into music, games, etc…) and contact.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a quick sketch of what this might look like:</p>
        <img
          src="images\Blog3BringInTheBass.png"
          alt="Landing page showing fader to 'bring in the bass'"
        />
        <img
          src="images\Blog3TitleCard.png"
          alt="Landing page with fader up and introduction title card"
        />

        <h3>HTML:</h3>
        <p>
          At the moment, my prototype website is structured with subfolders and
          separate html documents for each page. I would very much like to
          change this to all being accessible on one page, but more research
          will be needed on how to achieve this (or if I'm allowed to do this at
          all).
        </p>
        <p>
          Markup wise, I think the fader will use the slider class and be
          encased in the dreaded <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Syncing audio and animating the introduction of the text, navigation
          and buttons will be done with JS which I'll need to look into.

        <h3>IxD Process:</h3>

        <p>
          My goals for the website remain the same. Simple, communicable,
          flavourful. I don't want users to have to 'explore' the website. They
          shouldn't be looking for links or pages they haven't seen yet. I want
          users to have each feature and piece of information introduced to
          them. I want users to be able to see my work and have a fairly
          unpretentious, complete image of me (my skillset and personality)
          without having to search for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The target audience of this website is potential employers or
          collaborators. The user 'path' through the website should introduce
          me, my work and then (ideally) introduce them to me with an
          uncomplicated and unintimidating contact section.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all likelihood, my career is going to be in software development
          more than music or game design. Therefore content wise, showcases will
          prioritise technically impressive software work. There likely won't be
          much overlap in interest between users of this site, so some UI to
          section and hide irrelevant content will keep the UX fairly
          straightforward.
        </p>

        <img
          src="images\Blog4WireframeMap.png"
          width="550"
          alt="Wireframe map of the website"
        />

        <p>
          The original design goal of the website hasn't veered from its
          emphasis on simplicity. Balancing that maxim of minimal clutter with
          enough fun design to be interesting may prove a challenge as the
          website takes shape.

          The state of our official government departmental websites is
          absolutely disastrous.
        </p>
        <h3>The Department of Basic Education</h3>
        <h4>HomePage</h4>
        <img src="images/BasicEducationHome.png" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The final entry of the navigation bar is cut off. unclear directions
            defeat the point of navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The entire homepage is cluttered with multiple types of content
            (Text, images, news links, social media windows, videos).
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a scrolling image display (not shown in screenshot) which
            has images of different dimensions as slides. Every time the
            dimensions of the display change, all the text on the website jumps
            up or down to accommodate the new image size.
          </li>
          <li>
            The newsroom snippet is laid out with narrow line spacing and small
            font size which makes it very difficult to separate entries and
            read.
          </li>
          <li>The newsroom headings on each page have inconsistent styling.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Media Releases Page</h4>
        <img src="images/BasicEducationMediaReleases.png" />
        <p>The Media releases page is the worst on the site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each release is sorted into half-year headings.</li>
          <li>
            Each release is a single line link with a title and date in small
            font and with little line spacing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite being links, there are no on-hover or visited styles for
            each link which makes it difficult to know if you have selected the
            right entry or find one you have visited.
          </li>
          <li>
            All entries older than April 2020 are missing due to a display
            error.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Perhaps the only kudos to give to the Department of Basic Education
          website is that it is constantly updated and all links and information
          are current and relevant.
        </p>
        <h3>South African Social Security Agency</h3>
        <h4>Homepage</h4>
        <img src="images/SASSAHome.png" alt="SASSA homepage" />

        <ul>
          <li>
            The header gives no information about the department or website, but
            is rather a scrolling display of outdated slides (see COVID SRD
            application status notice)
          </li>
          <li>
            Directly below the header we have a subtitle with the department
            motto that continuously scrolls across the page. Very distracting
            and still no information about what site I'm on.
          </li>
          <li>
            The search bar does not in fact search for anything. It just reloads
            the page you're on when you press submit.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 'SASSA Slide Gallery' is an animated cube, each side of which is
            an image and it turns every few seconds. Confusing style choice and
            completely inconsistent with the rest of the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a link to the PAIA Manual from 2021. There is a 2024 PAIA
            manual so this is just an out of date link.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the right sidebar we have a broken Twitter display and a badly
            fitted Facebook display.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The "Disclaimer"</h4>
        <img
          src="images/SASSADisclaimer.png"
          alt="A disclaimer on the SASSA site"
        />
        <p>
          This disclaimer is present on the contact page. The department
          responsible for social security and information protection warning
          that their site might be erroneous and they don't accept any
          responsibility for their misinformation or out of date information.
          The irony is palpable.

          The use of the internet as a channel for communication, education,
          work and entertainment has become ubiquitous in the 21st century. If
          there was any silver lining of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic it was the
          effect it had on global digital literacy and how much it showed us
          could be done using proper ICT tools. A study by David Mhlanga and
          Tankiso Moloi found that 4IR (fourth industrial revolution) tools had
          been implemented from primary school to tertiary education levels in
          South Africa to excellent success. The study notes the potential these
          tools have to decrease the strain on access to tertiary education
          which is a historical challenge in South Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the obvious benefits this technology brings to the education
          and work sector, an estimated 41% of the global population still did
          not have access to the internet according to an article by Claire
          Daniolou in 2020. Daniolou notes the digital divide that occurs
          between many rural communities and the urban world. These rural areas
          are often of lower income, education level and infrastructure. This
          leads to a lack of access to broadband connection. The tragedy of this
          is the amount of culture, local specialisation and unique services and
          products that these communities could bring to the global platform but
          is lost to their circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nature of hypertext is to mimic the way humans actually process
          knowledge and think thoughts. I don't think it's implausible to say
          that people didn't immediately epiphanise at the commercialising of
          hypertext because the concept is actually quite natural to us. The
          essay also asks if we'd want a revolution at all. What would happen if
          we pushed this system to its absolute limits? It warns about how
          systems taken to their extremes often do exactly the opposite of their
          intention. Looking at the world today, have we come to a point where a
          system designed to democratise knowledge gathering and sharing is
          instead being used to make knowledge exclusive or untrustworthy?
        </p>
        <h3>What can we do about it?</h3>
        <p>
          Daniolou mentions that government agencies as well as non-government
          and academic organisations such as GoGlobal are making an effort to
          provide broadband access to rural areas and integrate them into the
          global channel for communication, e-commerce and online education.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 2024 article by Sarah Payne details how the quality of education and
          number of educated youth in South African rural areas has increased
          dramatically since the introduction of internet connectivity to said
          areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having had an extremely privileged and tech-assisted career through
          school, I feel the importance of using modern technology to aid
          education is absolutely crucial. Since the advent of the internet, it
          has become the cornerstone of every sector of human productivity.
          Access to the internet has morphed from a privilege into a human right
          in the modern world. We cannot allow people to be left behind from the
          fast-evolving landscape of digital education and communication.

          >'The cities and towns that we live in were once constructed from
          bricks, concrete, glass, and steel. Now, though, the places we inhabit
          also consist of digital augmentations (Graham 2013): digital code and
          digital content like data from Wikipedia, photographs from Flickr,
          restaurant reviews from Yelp, and algorithms controlled by Google that
          make information visible or invisible. The digital augmentations of
          places, in other words, are beginning to matter as much as their
          material counterparts…'</cite

        <p>
          In the modern world, our first impressions of places is their
          representations on the internet. In this modern world, however, there
          still exists many communities that do not have the infrastructure to
          support widespread internet access or large scale online contribution.
          The major consequences of this are information incoming to these
          communities being mostly non-local; and the digital representation of
          these communities and locations being controlled by foreign
          impressions of them. This creates a global disconnect between the
          reality of a place and the digital representation of that place which
          is largely created by foreign biases towards it. China, for example,
          has its own local search engine and sphere of social media. The result
          of this is the global image of china being largely built by US
          sources. A study done at Cornell University analysed the effect of 267
          907 China-related articles published by The New York Times on
          population bias toward china and found that they explained 54% of the
          negative skewed variance in the public towards China. [1]

          information, search engines have created an informational
          infrastructure with precise characteristics, logics, and biases…The
          personalization of results is another researched aspect of search
          engines. Based on sophisticated and rich personal profiles, Google
          Search produces different content for different users, increasing and
          decreasing the visibility of links to deliver more relevant results.
          This process, according to Pariser (2011), might result in a “filter
          bubble,” in which users are systematically exposed only to content
          that matches their political and cultural inclinations…'</cite

        <p>
          Major Northern search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing all have
          massive influence on a user's perception of the world. They are
          particularly good at profiling users based on their tastes and
          opinions and providing content that is largely skewed towards the
          user's ideology. This creates a positive-feedback loop where users are
          only exposed to media to enforce their existing beliefs. Search
          engines are optimised to promote sensational content that invokes
          strong emotional response to boost engagement. This often includes
          extreme viewpoints that bolster a user's viewpoint or misinformation
          intending to radicalise them against opposition. [2]

          This figure shows the localness (the percentage of URLs on the search
          engine front page when searching the location's name that originate
          from said location) of each country's front page data. As seen in the
          figure, most countries have below 88 local pages displaying on their
          search engine front page. All countries with 88 or more URLs are
          countries with well-established Internet infrastructure such as the
          U.S., Canada, Russia and most of Europe. This illustrates how majority
          of the information and representation of countries in the Southern
          globe is controlled by Northern, more internet-adapted countries.

          hegemony, whereby producers in a few countries get to define what is
          read by others. The United States, in particular, is a dominant

          The digital divide between high-income communities with good internet
          infrastructure and low-income communities that lack these facilities
          continues to be a huge issue that is almost invisible globally. A
          large reason for the problem's invisibility is the underrepresentation
          of these disadvantaged places due to lack of locally produced content
          on them.

          The saying “When the U.S. sneezes, the world gets a cold,” aptly
          describes the amount of influence America has globally. The world
          adopts social norms and pop culture from the U.S. and is largely
          influenced by their politics and economy. In addition to this, it is
          clear from this study that the U.S. also controls our perception of
          other countries with majority of content about said countries being
          sourced from America. This control over the population's opinion of
          foreign cultures is extremely dangerous as it alienates all standards
          that deviate from those of the United States. Negative media
          portrayals of immigrants has been shown to increase hostility and
          prejudice towards foreigners in America [3]. This is likely to occur
          at a larger scale, throughout the West so long as majority of
          information about foreign countries is sourced from the U.S.

        <p>
          The study finds that the issue is not simply a matter of access to
          internet or local infrastructure. It finds that localness of online
          content is better predicted by the amount of scholarly content
          produced in the country. The problem then, is much deeper than one
          that can be solved by simply posting more local content. Perhaps the
          key to better online representation is the funding and bolstering of
          local educational and scientific facilities. This is not to say that
          there aren't steps to be taken by Google to minimise the bias created
          by their algorithm.

          If google were to make the source of webpages and their reason for
          ranking on the search page transparent to the public, it would largely
          decrease the media bias these sources would create by giving the user
          the awareness of how information they obtain may be skewed.

        <cite
          >“The ongoing dispute is still between two opposite positions... on
          the one hand the Internet increases and improves social relationships;
          on the other it negatively affects face to face relationships. [...]
          This chapter proposes a nuanced perspective which investigates the
          potential new applications of social capital in the context of digital
          divide and explores how social and digital capitals are
          interrelated.”[1]</cite
        >
        <p>
          While I agree that the internet has had a huge impact on social
          relationships, is it fair to say it negatively affects face to face
          relationships? There may be an argument that more social circles
          developing through digital platforms widens the digital divide as
          those unable to participate through internet access are isolated to
          groups on one side of the divide, but that doesn't imply any negative
          impact on face-to-face interactions where a digital platform is not
          involved. Personally, I've met and fostered relationships with many
          people online that has translated perfectly in a face-to-face dynamic.
        </p>
        <cite
          >“Coleman defined social capital as 'a variety of entities having two
          characteristics in common: they all consist of some aspects of a
          social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals
          who are within the structure.' [...] This makes social capital
          different than other forms of capitals. While economic capital is
          characterised by the possession of means of production, and human
          capital is based on individual skills, social capital is rooted in
          relationships between individuals.”[1]</cite
        >
        <p>
          If Social Capital is gained through relationships and enable
          collectives to achieve certain goals as a result, how many extra
          opportunities are afforded to those with internet access and social
          media than those without? The lost social connections due to the
          digital divide is likely far more consequential than is often
          discussed.
        </p>
        <cite>
          “Indeed, we do not access the Internet as a tabula rasa (blank slate),
          but on the background of our own social, cultural, political and
          personal capital. Our previous background influences how we access and
          use the Internet (first and second level) and how we reinvest valuable
          information in the social realm (third level) to improve our life
          chances.”[1]
        </cite>
        <p>
          The severity of the digital divide has become more apparent as we've
          worked to lessen its impact. The first level saw the divide as a
          simple have vs have-not situation where the root of the problem was
          many individuals not having access to the internet. When this problem
          was solved in many communities, we found that the divide is still
          present in terms of how communities use the internet. Many still
          lacked the skills and resources to use the internet effectively to
          augment their livelihood. The third level now is the difference in
          social capital between users. A user's prior history and interaction
          with social relationships on the internet and its capabilities to form
          such connections greatly impacts the opportunities and engagement a
          user can accumulate online.

          “It seems that the “virtual communities” included in the individual
          “digital capital” of users, rely on an already existing social capital
          based on relationships and trust among people located in specific
          places. At the same time the Internet might become a connector for
          “social movements” that work in different contexts but share
          information and useful insights widening their social networks and
          promoting co-operation.” [1]
        </cite>
        <p>
          I disagree that virtual communities rely on existing social capital.
          Virtual communities provide a source for digital and social capital by
          allowing for a public, openly accessible space for the sharing of
          ideas or information with no prior connections required. This is
          another reason the internet is a good connector for social movements.
          Many such movements are expanded due to a policy of online,
          anyone-is-welcome philosophy.

          “Social media platforms like Facebook allow users to maintain existing
          relationships while potentially expanding their networks through a
          'snowball effect.' However, these platforms can both reinforce
          homogeneity and bonding social capital, or generate bridging
          capital—depending on how inclusive and diverse the networks
          become.”[1]
        </cite>
        <p>
          This is a common case with social media platforms. Every social media
          platform has a target market and a political leaning. This results in
          many online spaces becoming echo chambers of same-minded people and
          thus the same ideas are validated repeatedly and become increasingly
          radical and extreme. Of what quality is any generated social capital
          from these spaces when its impact is reduced to the isolated space it
          originated from?

        <cite
          >“Cybertrust—confidence in the reliability of Internet platforms and
          the people on them—is essential to benefiting from online engagement.
          Those with greater digital capital are more able to navigate, protect
          their privacy, and maximize opportunities, while those with limited
          capital are more vulnerable to manipulation and narrowing algorithms.”

          Having a wider sphere of engagement on the internet exposes the user
          to more people of differing opinions or backgrounds. It also creates a
          greater awareness in the user for misinformation or manipulation.

          This course has greatly changed the way I approach designing programs.
          The modern world is technologically progressing at such a fast rate
          that many communities are excluded due to things like lack of access
          or infrastructure, lack of digital status quo and underrepresentation.

          My mindset has now become a very consumer-first one. I've realized the
          dangers of assuming things like the user having access to
          top-of-the-line utilities like cutting edge hardware or fast internet;
          basing things off data that may not be sourced from its topic origin
          and thereby only considering a western perspective (see my blog on
          where google search data originates by location); or even assuming
          English as a default language.

          the layout. A lot of the features I did with CSS can be done with
          JavaScript and it's convention to do any functionality with JS over
          CSS, so that's some more work to be done. Past that I've prototyped
          the audio feature and the background of the landing page but have yet

          I believe that these are foundational for an ethical internet. Though
          I do think that the bigger issue preventing an ethical internet
          currently is the rampant display of ads for addictive vices. Ads for
          alcohol, porn and gambling are displayed haphazardly on webpages,
          before videos and are occasionally endorsed by creators or channels on
          platforms like YouTube or Twitch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of these ads attempt to gamify these vices which attracts a
          younger audience. This is a dangerous and deceptive practice, the
          consequences of which are often severe financial, social or
          psychological damage. It also makes the internet a particularly risky
          place for recovering addicts to engage with.

          Europe government policy that abolishes any sort of advertisement of
          chance-based and digital currency exchange financial transactions in
          games is currently in the process of being legislated [1]. Ideally,
          any adds that promise the user the chance of winning any amount of
          money should be banned.

       Technology and art both have the power to cause massive social change. As a developer, I have a responsibility to uphold social justice and use my platform to amplify voices, represent others fairly and put the benefit of the user and the public above all.

          Approaching this workflow of ethics in my own work proves to be a complicated issue. As a beginner, my initial thought was ‘how can code be unethical at all?’ but since then I’ve come to learn about algorithmic biases, underrepresentation, assumptions about my user and discarding optimization (neglecting those with non-cutting-edge hardware).
        </p>

        <p>
          Even once you’re aware of these issues, it is still a challenge to create artefacts that minimise their presence.  Creating a 100% ethical body of work may be an impossible task, but what’s important is to strive to reach that impossible ceiling.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge that the added requirement of optimization or accessibility options or proper representation may add is however, highly beneficial for learning better coding practices or design patterns.

          For my website, which relies heavily on an audio theme, I’ve learnt to consider users that may not have the capability to engage with the sound features- be that because of hardware or physical disability. This inspired the challenge to create a visualizer for my site that translates the audio features into a visual flair, thereby including more users.
